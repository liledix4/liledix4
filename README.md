## Fun facts

*In alphabetical order*

- **AI:** I have a complicated relationship with it. I understand the position "AI is theft" and I'm on the same side. But the damage is done. It's na√Øve to not use the tools that already became a part of our modern lives. However, I'm not making my own contributions to AI, I'm not interested in it. Don't even suggest.
- **Plum jam:** my beloved! üòç
- **Political views:** I'm a staunch centrist. Depending on the cases, I can lean to the left or to the right. However, I don't think that it's correct to use the left-right political spectrum in the first place, because many situations are complex and this spectrum oversimplifies views, causing one to ignore important aspects. I'll never call myself a liberal or libertarian, by the way, because I never am: for example, I have liberal views, but I also have views contrary to liberalism. To conclude this list item, I don't talk about politics openly. I am in a censorship situation in real life.
- **Religion:** I believe in myself. üôÉ Okay, okay, jokes aside (however it's true, so it counts as a post-irony). I'm a deist. In conversations, it may sound like I'm an atheist, but in fact, I find it funny to think of the gods (plural, yes) as the entities who are not necessarily attached to the Earth, but more like they're somewhere across the whole wide universe. You never know. By the way, Bible means nothing, gods don't care about worshipping, and name any typical aspect of the religions, I'll tell you that deism is not about that. You can tell me various quotes from your religion and ask me if this deism of mine can portray the gods in detail in such a way that good and bad traits are noticed in them as in every human individual ‚Äì I'll tell you that it doesn't matter. Yeah, sure, I can make up stories that people will want to believe too (after all, I'm a bit of a writer), but since when do people attribute human traits to gods without knowing the veracity reliably? I apologize a million times, or however many times you want, but this goes against my strong stance of pragmatism. But my views on other religions don't prevent me from respecting people who share those religions. It's just one of the many aspects of their lives, and I love those people for the other things. I never get into arguments about religions, as it is impossible to change someone else's views - religion is the kind of thing that tends to be reinforced from an early age. I apologize if this sounds harsh, but think back to when you started getting into religion. You can't completely say that a person can choose a religion freely. It is part of a person's culture.
